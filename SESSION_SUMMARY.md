# Purtypics Gallery Generator - Session Summary

## Project Overview
Purtypics is a static photo gallery generator written in Go that creates beautiful, responsive photo galleries with a masonry layout. It's inspired by Hugo but focused specifically on photo galleries with high-quality image processing.

## What Was Completed Today

### 1. Video Support Implementation ✅
- Added support for video files (MOV, MP4, AVI, etc.)
- Created `pkg/video/processor.go` to handle video processing
- Implemented video thumbnail extraction using ffmpeg
- Added hover-to-play preview functionality
- Implemented video playback in lightbox with controls
- Added play button overlay on video thumbnails

### 2. Album Metadata System ✅
- Created metadata types and parser (`pkg/metadata/`)
- Supports YAML/JSON format for gallery configuration
- Integrated metadata loading into gallery generator
- Album features: custom titles, descriptions, cover photos, hiding
- Photo features: custom titles, descriptions, hiding
- Created web-based metadata editor (`pkg/editor/`)
- Editor UI with tabs for gallery, albums, and photos
- Visual editing with image previews
- Auto-save functionality with 2-second debounce
- Browser-based editor launches with `purtypics edit` command

### 3. Previous Features (Already Working)
- **Image Processing**: High-quality thumbnail generation with Lanczos filtering
- **EXIF Support**: Extracts and displays camera metadata
- **Smart Caching**: Only regenerates thumbnails when source files change
- **Responsive Masonry Layout**: Using desandro/masonry library
- **Sorting**: Albums sorted by newest first, photos within albums by oldest first
- **Lightbox**: Full-screen image/video viewing with EXIF data below
- **Auto-rotation**: Handles EXIF orientation correctly

## What's Left To Do

### 1. Create Album Management System (Medium Priority) ✅ COMPLETED
- Album metadata files (descriptions, custom sorting) ✅
- Cover photo selection ✅
- Album privacy settings ✅
- Metadata editor with web UI ✅
- Auto-save functionality ✅
- Custom album templates (still pending)

### 2. Create Installation Packaging (Low Priority)
- Build scripts for different platforms
- Package for Arch AUR
- Create APT/RPM packages
- Homebrew formula
- Installation documentation

### 3. Future Enhancements (Not Started)
- GPS mapping integration (show photos on a map)
- Search functionality
- Tags/categories system
- Multiple theme support
- Progressive web app features
- Image optimization settings
- Batch operations UI

## Known Issues
- Video hover preview may throw console errors on rapid hover/unhover (harmless)
- Map section shows placeholder text (GPS data is extracted but not visualized)

## Usage
```bash
# Build the tool
go build -o purtypics

# Generate a gallery
./purtypics generate -source /path/to/photos -output /path/to/output -title "My Gallery"

# With base URL for deployment
./purtypics generate -source photos -output dist -title "My Gallery" -baseurl "https://example.com/gallery"

# Edit metadata using web interface
./purtypics edit -source /path/to/photos

# Generate with custom metadata file
./purtypics generate -source photos -metadata custom-gallery.yaml
```

## Dependencies
- Go 1.19+
- ffmpeg (for video support)
- No Go dependencies beyond stdlib except:
  - github.com/rwcarlsen/goexif/exif
  - golang.org/x/image/draw

## Testing
The example directory contains test photos with various EXIF orientations and 2 MOV video files for testing video support.
